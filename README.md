# Gogol

Welcome to **Gogol**, your go-to tool for rapidly creating projects in various programming languages, checking your system's configuration, and facilitating the installation of missing languages. Whether you are starting a simple project or setting up libraries, Gogol is here to streamline the process for you.

## Features

- üõ†Ô∏è **Quickly create projects** in multiple programming languages, including the libraries you need.
- üîç **Check if your computer meets the necessary configuration** and if the required languages are installed.
- üí° **Easily install missing languages** to get your environment ready.

## Examples of Usage

### Creating a Basic Application in Go

```bash
gogol new basic -l go -n myapp
```

### Checking Configuration for Haskell

```bash
gogol new basic -l haskell -n haskell_app
```

## Future Plans

Currently, Gogol supports creating simple basic projects and libraries. In the future, I plan to implement a broader range of applications with many languages, including:

- APIs
- Command Line Interfaces (CLI)
- Networking Applications
- Server Applications
- Cloud Applications
